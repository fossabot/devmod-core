> The core of devmod's 6th iteration.

devmod is a project started by and for the [devcord](https://devcord.com)
community on discord. It was written in typescript as part of devcord's
topic of the month (March 2020), in which typescript was the month's
featured topic. The bot was written with modularity, transparency, and
ease of use, and was reworked from the ground up in an effort to make
the bot more stable.

## W.I.P.
This bot is currently in the very early stages of the rewrite. This
readme will grow with the bot, so expect more information on how to use
the bot once it's ready for use.
